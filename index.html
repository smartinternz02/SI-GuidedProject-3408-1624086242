                    Exercise is an important healt behaviour. Expressed reasons for participation are often
                    delayed outcomes i.e. health threats and benefits, but also enjoyment. 
                    However, we donot know how people evaluate exercise as a reward. Delay discounting rates (k) 
                    indicated that exercise was discounted like other consumable rewards at the same rate as food
                    and more rapidly than monetary rewards. Significant associations were detected of kex wiht 
                    preferred speed and with extrinsic exercise motivation. Exercise training (n = 16) reduced kex 
                    specifically, not affecting kfo. Our studies show, that participants perceived and discounted self-paced 
                    walking/running like a consumable reward. Exercise discounting was quicker in individuals who preferred 
                    lower speeds being less physically active and exercise training reduced the decay rate of exercise 
                    specifically.
